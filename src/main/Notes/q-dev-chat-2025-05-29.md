I got the error:
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.RuntimeException: Field &#39;name&#39; not found in object of type TypedValue

I'll help you fix the error "Field 'name' not found in object of type TypedValue". This error is occurring in the `GetNode` visitor method in the `Interpreter` class.

Looking at the error message and the code, I can see that the issue is in the `visitGetExpr` method of the `Interpreter` class. When trying to access a field from a `TypedValue` object, the code is trying to access the field directly, but `TypedValue` doesn't have a mechanism to access its internal fields.

Let's modify the `TypedValue` class to support field access:

---

Updating the visitGetExpr method to handle TypedValue objects properly by unwrapping the value before attempting to access fields

---



The issue is that when you're trying to access a field like `student.name`, the `student` variable is already wrapped in a `TypedValue` object, but the `visitGetExpr` method is trying to access the field directly on the `TypedValue` object rather than on the underlying value.

I've updated the `visitGetExpr` method to:

1. Check if the object is a `TypedValue` and unwrap it if needed
2. Properly handle field access for both `TypedValue` objects and regular objects
3. Return results wrapped in `TypedValue` objects with appropriate type information
4. Use `RuntimeError` consistently for better error reporting

This should fix the error by ensuring that field access works correctly on objects wrapped in `TypedValue` instances. Now when you access `student.name`, it will properly unwrap the `student` object from its `TypedValue` wrapper before trying to access the `name` field.

Try running your code again with this fix. The template should now be able to access the `name` field of the `Student` object correctly.

So, up untill now, how many thing are support in the newGrammar.txt?

Based on the code I've reviewed and the fix we just implemented, here's what's currently supported in your grammar:

1. **Basic HTML templating** - HTML content outside of {% %} blocks is passed through
2. **Variable declarations** - `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `String`, and custom types
3. **Control flow statements**:
   - `if`/`else` statements
   - `while` loops
   - `for` loops
4. **Expressions**:
   - Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
   - Comparison operations (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`)
   - Logical operations (`&&`, `||`)
   - Unary operations (`!`, `-`)
5. **Object field access** - Accessing fields with dot notation (e.g., `student.name`)
6. **Basic assignment** - Simple variable assignment with `=`

The following features from your grammar are **not yet fully implemented**:
1. Conditional expressions (`?:` ternary operator)
2. Complex assignments (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`)
3. Array access (`array[index]`)
4. Function calls
5. Bitwise operations and their assignments

Your recent fix specifically addressed the field access functionality, allowing proper access to object properties through dot notation, which is defined in the grammar under `field_access`.

Please don&#39;t modify the typeName in TypedValue in Interpreter.
Let&#39;s implement the array access features.

---

To implement array access features, we need to add several components to the interpreter. Let's create the necessary classes and modify existing ones to support array access.

First, let's create an `ArrayAccessNode` class to represent array access expressions:

Adding the array access visitor method to the ExprVisitor interface

Let me try again with the correct approach.

Let me implement the array access feature step by step:

---

Updating the AstPrinter class to implement the missing visitor methods

---

Updating the Interpreter class to implement the array access visitor method

---

Updating the Parser to support array access expressions

---



Now I've implemented array access functionality for your language. Here's what I've added:

1. Created an `ArrayAccessNode` class to represent array access expressions like `array[index]`
2. Updated the `ExprVisitor` interface to include the `visitArrayAccessExpr` method
3. Implemented the `visitArrayAccessExpr` method in the `Interpreter` class to handle array access for:
   - Lists
   - Arrays
   - Strings (character access)
   - Maps (key-based access)
4. Updated the `Parser` class to recognize array access syntax with square brackets `[]`
5. Added proper error handling for array access operations

The implementation supports:
- Accessing elements in arrays, lists, and maps using the square bracket notation
- Proper type checking and error handling for invalid array accesses
- Consistent return of `TypedValue` objects with appropriate type information

This completes the array access feature as defined in your grammar under `array_access â†’ expr_name "[" expression "]"`.

You can now use array access syntax in your templates, such as:
```
{% String[] names = {"John", "Jane", "Bob"}; %}
{% names[0] %}
```

Or with maps:
```
{% Map<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>(); %}
{% scores["John"] = 95; %}
{% scores["John"] %}
```

I cannot do things like:     {% for (int i = 0; i &lt; ss.length; i = i+1) { %}
        {% ss[i] %}
    {% } %}
because the length field is not found for the array

---

Let me fix the array length access issue by updating the `visitGetExpr` method in the Interpreter class:

---

Adding special handling for the 'length' property on arrays, lists, and strings

---

Let me try a different approach to fix the array length access issue:

---

Updating the Interpreter class to handle the 'length' property for arrays, lists, and strings

---



I've added support for the `length` property on arrays, which will fix the issue with accessing array lengths in your code. Now you can use code like:

```java
{% for (int i = 0; i < ss.length; i = i+1) { %}
    {% ss[i] %}
{% } %}
```

The key change is in the `visitGetExpr` method, where I've added special handling for the `length` property. When the field name is "length", the interpreter now checks if the object is:

1. An array (`Object[]`) - returns the array's length
2. A list (`List`) - returns the list's size
3. A string (`String`) - returns the string's length

This implementation handles the `length` property at the beginning of the method, before the regular field access logic, ensuring it works for both TypedValue objects and regular objects.

This approach is minimal and focused specifically on solving the array length access issue without modifying any other functionality.
