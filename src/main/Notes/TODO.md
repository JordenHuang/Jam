# TODO

- [ ] Choose "template" as the extension or use others (like "jam")? (Something like: Write some code in your jam file
      would be cool)
- [ ] Provide different output types, standard output as well as write to file
- [ ] Variables can not be declared multiple times in the same block
- [ ] Implement variable pass in
- [ ] Implement the `include "something.template"` statement in code block
- [ ] Allow user defined types (Parser should recognize that, and Interpreter should handle that as well)
