# TODO

- [ ] Implement the `include "something.template"` statement in code block
- [ ] Allow user defined types (Parser should recognize that, and Interpreter should handle that as well)

## Done (from recent to old)

- [x] Provide different output types, standard output as well as write to file
- [x] Implement variable pass in
- [x] Variables can not be declared multiple times in the same block
- [x] Choose "template" as the extension or use others (like "jam")? (Something like: Write some code in your jam file
  would be cool)
